## Objective

The objective of this project was to create an app that allows users to enter Markdown text in a text area and see the corresponding rendered HTML output in a preview area. The project aimed to demonstrate the use of front-end technologies and frameworks, with a focus on React.

## User Stories

2. Users can input GitHub-flavored Markdown in the "editor" window, and it is rendered as HTML in the "preview" window.
3. Upon initial load, the "editor" field contains a default valid Markdown that includes elements such as headings, links, lists, etc.
4. Upon initial load, the default Markdown in the "editor" field is rendered as HTML in the "preview" window.
